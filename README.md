# pathological
Go from State A to State B. And possibly maintain desired state.

a) Examples of StateA to StateB. Same Type to Type
a.1) Path needed to go from Position A to Position B. 
a.2) Path needed to go from Graph A to Graph B
a.3) Path needed to go from Stats A to Stats B
a.4) Path needed to go from Number A to Number B.
a.5) Path needed to go from String A to String B.
a.6) Path needed to go from Character A to Character B.
a.7) Path needed to go from LocationA to LocationB.
a.8) Path needed to go from LanguageA to LanguageB.

This will combine gis maps and non gis maps together
so that the AI can be pathological.
